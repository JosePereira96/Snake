# Snake

This is a version of the classic game Snake coded by me. 


## Description

Snake is single player video game where the player maneuvers the end of a growing line, often themed as a snake. The player must keep the snake from colliding with both other obstacles (the walls) and itself, which gets harder as the snake lengthens. The snake's length and speed increases with each piece of food eaten. 

## Installation
